## Future Plans & Improvements
- Transcripts (diarized)
- Browser extension to add videos to processing queue directly from YouTube
- Localization (translate UI to more languages than just English)
- Support for more platforms than just YouTube (like Apple Podcasts)
- Fullscreen mode (lol)
- Recently played items, starred/pinned iterms, archived items
- Multi-process architecture for `diarize_loop` and `metadata_loop` to allow killable jobs (lol)
- Auto-add YouTube videos when a channel uploads
- Remember speakers by voice (cosine similarity on embedding centroids), explore facial recognition
