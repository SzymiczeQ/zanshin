> Large parts of the frontend make the Tower of Babel look like a model of good planning and execution

Look, this was my first big frontend project. I now know how to do a much better job, and will apply those learnings as I rewrite all the messy parts over the coming weeks and months.

I acknowledge the frontend code is not in a great state right now. To compensate, the best I can do right now is link a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmKwD0NaHuw).

So if you look at some files in here and feel worse than being inside Chernobyl Reactor 4, don't say I didn't warn you.

Proceed with caution. You may not come back the same person...
