I'd like to thank

    My friend Steven Zhou, who worked with me on this project in the early days.
        Many of the concepts and directions this project took wouldn't have emerged without the many conversations and brainstorming sessions we had.
        He also helped and contributed financially in buying hardware & parts to get the project off the ground.

    My friend Ori Navoiy, who lent me his gaming PC to experiment with speaker diarization on.

    My friend Ahmad Rao, who helped me film an initial demo video for this project at Artist Point, Mt. Baker Ski Area, WA.

    My friends Akki Singh and Rishit Singh who provided feedback on the project and encouraged me to keep at it.
